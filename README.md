### Geography

I live in the city of Bogot√° D.C. in Colombia, but you find me in 
Buenos Aires, Argentina in non-pandemic days.

### Reading

Three of my favorite books are:

- *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien
- *Foundation* by Isaac Asimov
- *1984* by George Orwell

### Food

I love seafood, shrimp in ceviche and breaded squid are my favorite dishes.
